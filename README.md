# GA_&_DE-Based-SCR
Optimisation_Algorithm_Speech_command_classification
The codes are an implementation of genetic algorithm (GA) and Differential Algorithm (DE) based CNN hyper parameters search for speech command recognition (SCR) task.
The code is writtern using the following libraries:
1. ***tensorflow 2.8.0***
2. ***keras 2.9.0***
3. ***scikit-learn 1.0.2***
4. ***librosa 0.8.1***
5. ***numpy version 1.21.6***     
MFCC features are considered using the python library ***python_speech_features***
